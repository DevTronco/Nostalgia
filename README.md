# Nostalgia
Nostaglia.exe is a virus made of pure boredom and willing to waste time, it does nothing in particular, it just kills your pc with overwriting MBR after entrateiningyou with 4 minutes of an old Alan Walker song.

I DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSABILITY BY ANY IMPRORPIATE USE OF THOSE LINES OF CODE.
This virus was made by boredom and to also make people see the internals of a simple, killer malware.
DO NOT EVER RUN THIS OUTSIDE A DEDICATED VM, it will kill your PC (MBR overwrite is hard to recover).
